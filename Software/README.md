Firmware sources

We used repetier firmware 0.91 with teensylu pinout readressing and some minor changes and customisation.
You will found the a simple version and another version compatible LCD

Firmware updater Beta
-------------------------
*Windows only (still working on the linux version)

This software will simplify your firmware update or modification, you should be able to send a precompiled firmware into your Teensylu with 4 mouses clicks.

This application is an encapsulation of avrdude in java in order to easily update or modify you current firmware. 
You will need to install Java jr7 before using it.
If you have any feedback do not hesitate.

Note:
-Require a recent java installation

*New Manual update: works directly in the terminal, no gui.
